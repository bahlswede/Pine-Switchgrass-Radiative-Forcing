# Pine-Switchgrass-Radiative-Forcing
Repo for data and code for the comparison of southern pine and switchgrass radiative forcing
Files and data required to build models of NEP and Albedo and compare the differences to produce a radiative forcing from conversion. Chains and predictions are first produced using the NEP_uncertainty.R and Albedo_uncertainty.R scripts. The remainder of the analysis uses the chains produced in those scripts in the RF_Albedo_Carbon_Net.R script.
